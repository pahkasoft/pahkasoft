## Hi there 👋

I’m an independent software developer. I’ve been working on these projects for quite some time — some are over five years old. In summer 2025, I decided to go open source.

### Resources

- Project repositories are available at this site.
- Additional resources are available at [**pahkasoft.github.io**](https://pahkasoft.github.io/).

### The Name PahkaSoft

The name **PahkaSoft** was chosen a little bit with a wink in the eye.

> **Pahka** — *a natural wooden burl formed when a tree grows irregularly, creating dense, swirling grain patterns often prized for their unique beauty in woodworking.*  
>
> *It symbolizes **imperfection turned into strength and beauty**, a fitting metaphor for software that is **handcrafted, resilient, and organically complex.***  
>
> **Pronunciation:** /ˈpɑːkɑ sɒft/ — *PAH-kah-soft*
